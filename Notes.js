/*
Old Websites(server-side rendering):
  before 2010, all the website are all server-side rendering
  this means all the HTML, CSS, and javascript codes are all loaded on the server
  because there are no a lot of code in javascript, so it works
New Way(client-side rendering):
  
The Goal of Front End Web APP:
  handling the data and updating the GUI
  which means it just need to keep the interface updated
  BUT
  it is really hard and almost impossible to keep all the interconnecting data updated with vanilla Javascript
  REASONS:
    1. with basic javascript we need to do a lot of DOM manipulations, like selection and manipulation, so this lead to a nightmare of a mess of code in large applications
    2. Vanilla Javascript store mode of the data in the DOM do it makes to hard to find bugs when there are multiple statements change the same DOM element. 

Side Notes:
  piece of data = piece of state
